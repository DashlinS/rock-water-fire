# Rock Water Fire


  This project was a great experience! To be able to create based on one of my favorite cartoons was educational and fun! I was able to implement my thoughts from my wire frame and it came out better than expected. Let me know your thoughts!

# What I Learned

I got a better understanding of the DOM and debugging. There we moments where I was not understand where the problem was, so I used the console constantly to find the bugs and what was affecting the code overall. 
I learned how to use `arguments` and `parameters` when connecting different functions. These lessons helped me figure out my other projects and how to research and problem solve.

## How Its Made 

**Languages used:** Html, CSS, Javascript

# What I Learned

I got a better understanding of the DOM and debugging. There we moments where I was not understand where the problem was, so I used the console constantly to find the bugs and what was affecting the code overall. 
I learned how to use `arguments` and `parameters` when connecting different functions. These lessons helped me figure out my other projects and how to research and problem solve.
